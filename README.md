## General Info
This is my personal homepage. It is created with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and deployed on GitHub Pages. 

I wanted to keep things simple, so I decided to go for a One Page design. Also, since it's all about responsiveness these days, the website is built with a mobile first philosophy and it also offers the possibility to toggle between light and dark mode.

The live version can be viewed at [anlifi.github.io](https://anlifi.github.io/).

A video demo can be found [here]().
