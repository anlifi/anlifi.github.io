## General Info
This is my personal homepage, created with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills, experience, and personal interests in a visually appealing and interactive manner. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, providing easy access and seamless browsing.

To ensure a user-friendly experience, I opted for a One Page design. This design choice allows visitors to navigate through the website without having to load separate pages, providing a smooth and immersive experience. Additionally, I implemented a mobile-first philosophy, ensuring that the website is responsive and accessible on different devices and screen sizes. Users can enjoy a seamless browsing experience whether they are accessing the site from their desktop computers, tablets, or smartphones.

One notable feature of the website is the ability to toggle between light and dark mode. I wanted to provide users with the flexibility to customize their viewing experience according to their preferences. This feature enhances usability, reduces eye strain in low-light environments, and adds a touch of personalization to the website.

## Technologies
This project is created using the following technologies:

* HTML5: Used for structuring the content and layout of the website.

* JavaScript - ECMAScript 2017: Implemented to provide interactive features and dynamic functionality.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and folders:

* `index.html`: This HTML file serves as the main source of the webpage, defining its structure and content.
* `site.webmanifest`: This file is used by Android devices to display the website correctly and provide an app-like experience when added to the home screen.
* `resources/`: This folder contains various resources utilized in the project, such as CSS and JavaScript files, as well as images.
  - `css/reset.css`: This CSS file resets the default styling provided by the browser, ensuring consistent rendering across different platforms.

## Design Choices
During the development of my personal homepage, I carefully considered various design choices to create an optimal user experience. Here are some key decisions I made and the reasoning behind them:

1. **One Page design**: I chose to implement a One Page design to provide a seamless browsing experience without the need for page refreshes. This design approach allows visitors to easily navigate through different sections of the website, accessing all the relevant information without interruption.

2. **Mobile-first philosophy**: With the increasing usage of mobile devices for web browsing, I prioritized mobile responsiveness during the development process. By adopting a mobile-first approach, I ensured that the website is well-optimized for smaller screens and touch interactions. This design choice guarantees a smooth and enjoyable experience for visitors accessing the site from their smartphones or tablets.

3. **Light and dark mode toggle**: To enhance user accessibility and customization options, I incorporated a toggle switch that allows users to switch between light and dark modes. This feature provides flexibility, catering to users' personal preferences and reducing eye strain in different lighting conditions. It adds a personal touch to the website and aligns with the modern trend of offering theme options. 
Also, I personally always choose the dark mode on any app or website if there is one, so this was a must to implement on my website.

4. **Animated skill bars**: In order to make the skills section visually engaging, I utilized the delighters.js library to create animated skill bars that appear when scrolling. This interactive element adds an element of surprise and captivates the user's attention while showcasing my proficiency in various areas.

By carefully considering these design choices, I aimed to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and engaging personal homepage that effectively presents my skills and interests to visitors.
